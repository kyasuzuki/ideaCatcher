      Speaker 1: So the problem we’re trying to tackle is how can we make students stay awake during class? <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 2: Currently students will consume coffee or tea to stay awake. <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 1: They’ll also exercise or meditate. <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 2: A lot of these products are costly. <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 1: And activities also take up additional time. <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 2: Right, so we should try to come up with a solution that doesn’t cost a lot and doesn’t take up a lot of time. <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 1: Here’s an idea: a buddy system where students would pump up one another. Done <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 2: Another idea: teachers lead a light physical activity every twenty minutes. Done <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 1: Yeah I really like that because I get tired during different times in class. <br>
      <br>
      Speaker 2: Idea. Have a short meditation session at the beginning of class so students are more alert Done. <br>
      <br>
      ... etc.

      Idea: Teachers provide healthy brainfood snacks to students such as blueberries or mint gum. <br>
      <br>
      Idea: Teacher's include group interactive activities during class which allow the students to move around a bit.<br>
      <br>
      Idea: Students bring fidget spinners to class to keep students focused and calm. <br>
      <br>
      Idea: Teacher's include a daily partner projects as a part of their curriculum. <br>
